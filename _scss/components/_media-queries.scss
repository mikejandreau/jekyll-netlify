// Media Queries
//––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

// Note: The best way to structure the use of media queries is to create the queries
// near the relevant code. For example, if you wanted to change the styles for buttons
// on small devices, paste the mobile query code up in the buttons section and style it
// there.

// Larger than mobile
@include mobile {}

// Larger than phablet (also point when grid becomes active)
@include phablet {}

// Larger than tablet
@include tablet {}

// Larger than laptop
@include laptop {}

// Larger than Desktop
@include desktop {}

// Larger than HD
@include hdtv {}
